openLilyLib Engraving Challenges
================================

Challenge 1 - Chopin/Godowsky
-----------------------------

As the idea for these challenges arose from engraving complex late-romantic piano music
it seems natural to start with such a challenge.  But we decided *not* to use a song by Oskar
Fried as the first task because we thought it appropriate to start something from scratch
ourselves. The issue was to find something of uttermost complexity in the late romantic
piano repertoire, but something that's clearly out of copyright.  
I found something which I found ideal:
[Leopold Godowsky's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Godowsky)
arrangements of Schubert songs, a music that is flourishing with wonderful polyphonic
additions and inventions - and an engraver's nightmare ;-)
The issue is that - although Godowsky died more than 70 years ago, giving his music
to the public domain in most countries - these pieces have been published in the U.S.
less than 90 years ago ...

After some pondering I recalled the five volumes of Godowksy's "Studies on Chopin's studies"
that I own but (as a pianist) never dared to touch so far. These pieces have been published
in Germany, so they are actually free to use.  
Surprisingly they are comparably simple notation-wise, but I think I found a nice example
and challenging task: a page from the study on Chopin's study in a minor op. 25/11.

So now you're ready to take off!

As this is the first challenge the "rules" or "contributor's guide" aren't really refined
or tested yet. So please don't start hacking away but rather try to check back with someone
else before.

Please remember: This is a challenge and only partly a contest. It is not the goal to finish
the assignment as fast as possible, it's not even mandatory to actually *finish* it -
you may also concentrate on a single staff or even measure. The point is trying to get the
most perfect end-result and to create a retraceable, well-documented progress on your way
there.
